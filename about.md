    <p>I received my PhD in geophysics from the Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México, Mexico in 2015. My PhD was focused on imaging active volcanoes using correlations of ambient seismic field: a technique with which we can extract coherent waves propagating between seismometers by correlating interference patterns of chaotic waves. I joined the earthquake seismology group led by Greg Beroza in the fall of 2015. My research aims to gain a better understanding of the Earth via a combination of observational and interpretational work on seismic data. I am interested in imaging the Earth at every scale - i.e., from the shallow sub-surface to the deepest Earth interfaces such as the core mantle boundary -, understanding volcanic and hydrothermal systems and predicting ground motion caused by earthquakes. More broadly, the integration of my research helps mitigating the risks that certain and inevitable natural disasters pose to human populations.</p>
