In the winter term of 2020 (January), I will join the Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences at the [University of Michigan](https://lsa.umich.edu/earth) as an Assistant Professor.  

I will be looking for motivated **graduate students** to work with me on topics related to ambient-field seismology with Distributed Acoustic Sensing (DAS) and/or dens arrays of conventional sensors. Topics of interest will include, subsurface imaging, Engineering seismology, volcano monitoring (with DAS!), environmental seismology, ocean physics with with ocean-bottom DAS or ground motion prediction under an observational and computational point of view. If you are also interested in Machine Learning, inversion methods and data mining, we'll find a nice multi-disciplinary project for you.  

Information about the graduate application process at the University of Michigan can be found [here](https://rackham.umich.edu/admissions/applying/). 

**Postdoc position(s)** should also be available, so I will continuously be looking for potential collaborators - don't hesitate to reach out.
